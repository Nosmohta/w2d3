# TinyApp Project

This TinyApp project has been designed to emulate the functionality of URL shortening services such as tinyurl.com.
The focus of this project has been to utilise the expressJS web framework to build a simple app. The express cookies-session module has been used to managed user sessions securely with incrypted user IDs.
